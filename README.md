Beach

Search a location and be given current weather information!

This site will search a location, show it on Google Maps, and then give the latest local weather information, updated hourly.

The search is done using Google's Geocoding Api.
This gives us the latitude and longitude which is then plugged into the google maps, and Stormglass Api. Then Google Maps updates with the current Lat/Long, and the weather results from Storm Glass are displayed.
